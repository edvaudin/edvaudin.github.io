            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a town planner, programmer, game maker and musician from the UK.

            <h3>Programmer</h3>
            <p>Growing up, I had tried a few times to learn to code, but it took until a few years ago for me to appreciate the small wins in learning.
                First getting a program to write to you, then to respond to your input. It took me a long time to realise how powerful those things are.
                I must give my thanks to the <a href="https://www.thecsharpacademy.com">C# Academy</a>, which laid out a solid roadmap of software projects that utilise C# and databasing.
                You can find my implementation of those projects in my <a href="./software.html">software portfolio</a>.

            <h3>Game Maker</h3>
            <p>
                As a child, I had made quite a few games on software like Scratch and GameMaker. Whilst those projects are lost to time, the interest has never faded.
                Around the time of the pandemic, I started learning Unity and C# through the courses by GameDevTV. Like the C# Academy, these got me making quick games thick and fast.
                By now, I have made many many games and am learning with every single one.
                You can find what I have made so far in my <a href="./games.html">games portfolio</a>.

            <h3>Musician</h3>
            <p>
                Around 2012, I started playing with Fruity Loops. Today, in 2023, I still play with Fruity Loops, and release music under the name 'Xarvus'.
                I have been making music for over a decade and I have honed a style for myself which can be summed up as atmospheric electronic music coated in reverb.
                The best place to view my discography is on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/598i6JqGnR3OZpT74grWAa">Spotify</a>. If you want to read a bit about each release I have made, check out my <a href="./music.html">music portfolio</a>.

            <h3>Town Planning</h3>
            <p>I graduated from Newcastle University in 2021 with a Masters in Planning with a 2:1.
                Since then, I have been working as a planning officer for the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead.
                I have a special interest in digitising the planning process so that our current bloated system can adapt to the future.
                I will be exploring small, open-source projects I can take on to make a step-by-step difference.
