                <p>This was a month long project for the Boss Rush Game Jam 2025 with my friend Spider.
                    The theme for the jam was 'Spin', what we ended up polishing was a souls and rogue-like gladiator arena.

                <p>My partner and I submitted this game for the GameDevTV Game Jam 2023. The theme for this jam was: 'Life in 2 Dimensions.
                    This game is a 2D top-down roguelike where you play as a Dreamweaver - a being that can enter people's dreams and save them from nightmares.

                <p>This was my submission to Mini Jam 103, which had the theme 'darkness' and the limitation 'you are your own enemy'. 
                    This is a 2D platformer where you are constantly shooting a laser forward and you need to avoid lasering yourself with the mirrors.
                    I am very proud of this submission as it came 11th out of over 100 submissions and showed it can be done without the need for loads of assets.

                <p>This was a submission for Mini Jam 101, which has the theme 'limit' and the limitation 'control the environment'. 
                    I undertook this in a team of three. We built a 2D top-down envirionment management game that has you doing small tasks around the map 
                    whilst trying to avoid dying to the hordes of enemies. How long can you survive?

                <p>This is my team's submission for Brackey's Game Jam 2022.2, for which the theme was 'you are not alone'. 
                    This is a 2D platform-shooter where you reflect enemy fire with your shield and try and save scientists from the robot factory!

                <p>This is my friend and I's trippy submission for the Brackeys Game Jam 2021, which had the theme 'this is not real'. 
                    Here you play as a sleep deprived office worker who needs to pay attention to the clues in his hallucinations to escape!
