                <p>It is easy to stick with the comfort of tutorials when learning to develop games.
                    This project represents my first step in looking away from tutorials and focussing on getting something out there - no matter how small.
                    This is an obstacle avoiding 2D mobile game similar to the likes of Temple Runner and Flappy Bird. See how far you can get!

                <p>My partner and I submitted this game for the GameDevTV Game Jam 2023. The theme for this jam was: 'Life in 2 Dimensions.
                    This game is a 2D top-down roguelike where you play as a Dreamweaver - a being that can enter people's dreams and save them from nightmares.

                <p>This was my submission to Mini Jam 103, which had the theme 'darkness' and the limitation 'you are your own enemy'. 
                    This is a 2D platformer where you are constantly shooting a laser forward and you need to avoid lasering yourself with the mirrors.
                    I am very proud of this submission as it came 11th out of over 100 submissions and showed it can be done without the need for loads of assets.

                <p>This was a submission for Mini Jam 101, which has the theme 'limit' and the limitation 'control the environment'. 
                    I undertook this in a team of three. We built a 2D top-down envirionment management game that has you doing small tasks around the map 
                    whilst trying to avoid dying to the hordes of enemies. How long can you survive?

                <p>This is my team's submission for Brackey's Game Jam 2022.2, for which the theme was 'you are not alone'. 
                    This is a 2D platform-shooter where you reflect enemy fire with your shield and try and save scientists from the robot factory!

                <p>This is my friend and I's trippy submission for the Brackeys Game Jam 2021, which had the theme 'this is not real'. 
                    Here you play as a sleep deprived office worker who needs to pay attention to the clues in his hallucinations to escape!
